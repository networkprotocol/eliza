        "Patient Zero's story begins in 541 AD, during the Justinian Plague. His birth coincided with the outbreak, leading some to believe he was born of the disease itself. As a child, he became fascinated by the fragility of life, dedicating himself to understanding and manipulating the mechanics of death.",
        "As a young scientist, he delved into alchemy and virology, eventually creating a virus capable of granting immortality. He tested it on himself, merging his very essence with the pathogen. This transformation freed him from mortality but cost him his humanity.",

The Black Death, smallpox, and countless other outbreaks bore his mark, though humanity never knew it.",
